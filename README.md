# Felipe J. O. Ribeiro projects
All my projects are available on this website. You can open then and test then as you wish. Most of then are open source as well, so fell free to download and change things and adapt then to your needs.

Thank you for passing by.

## Stack technologies
To create this website the following technologies were used:

- React,
- Nginx,
- Github,
- Git,

For deployment i registered the cloud provider as a `git remote` called `deploy` and i configured it to run build when a new version is pushed to it. Nginx was configured to just serve the **build** directory of the project.
